The cycling of Navs through open, closed and inactivated states, and their closely choreographed relationships with the activities of other ion channels lead to exquisite control of intracellular ion concentrations in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we present the 2.45 Å resolution crystal structure of the complete {NavMs} prokaryotic sodium channel in a fully open conformation. A canonical activated conformation of the voltage sensor S4 helix, an open selectivity filter leading to an open activation gate at the intracellular membrane surface and the intracellular C-terminal domain are visible in the structure. It includes a heretofore unseen interaction motif between W77 of S3, the S4-S5 interdomain linker, and the C-terminus, which is associated with regulation of opening and closing of the intracellular gate.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides are widely used as one of the most effective control measures in the global fight against agricultural arthropod pests and mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria and dengue. They exert toxic effects by altering the function of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential for proper electrical signaling in the nervous system. A major threat to the sustained use of pyrethroids for vector control is the emergence of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids worldwide. Here, we report the successful expression of a sodium channel, {AaNav}1-1, from Aedes aegypti in Xenopus oocytes, and the functional examination of nine sodium channel mutations that are associated with pyrethroid resistance in various Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae populations around the world. Our analysis shows that five of the nine mutations reduce {AaNav}1-1 sensitivity to pyrethroids. Computer modeling and further mutational analysis revealed a surprising finding: Although two of the five confirmed mutations map to a previously proposed pyrethroid-receptor site in the house fly sodium channel, the other three mutations are mapped to a second receptor site. Discovery of this second putative receptor site provides a dual-receptor paradigm that could explain much of the molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid action and resistance as well as the high selectivity of pyrethroids on insect vs. mammalian sodium channels. Results from this study could impact future prediction and monitoring of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes and other arthropod pests and disease vectors.},

All wild-type channels can be modified by {\textless}10 {nM} deltamethrin, but high affinity binding requires channel opening: (a) modification is promoted more by trains of brief depolarizations than by a single long depolarization, (b) the voltage dependence of modification parallels that of channel opening, and (c) modification is promoted by toxin {II} from Anemonia sulcata, which slows inactivation. The mutations reduce channel opening by enhancing closed-state inactivation. In addition, these mutations reduce the affinity for open channels by 20- and 100-fold, respectively. Deltamethrin inhibits channel closing and the mutations reduce the time that channels remain open once drug has bound. The super-kdr mutations effectively reduce the number of deltamethrin binding sites per channel from two to one. Thus, the mutations reduce both the potency and efficacy of insecticide action.},

	abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channels are the primary target of pyrethroid insecticides. Although it is well known that specific mutations in insect sodium channels confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to pyrethroids, the atomic mechanisms of pyrethroid-sodium channel interactions are not clearly understood. Previously, computer modeling and mutational analysis predicted two pyrethroid receptors, pyrethroid receptor site 1 ({PyR}1) (initial) and pyrethroid receptor site 2 ({PyR}2), located in the domain interfaces {II}/{III} and I/{II}, respectively. The models differ in ligand orientation and the number of transmembrane helices involved. In this study, we elaborated a revised {PyR}1 model of the mosquito sodium channel. Computational docking in the Kv1.2-based open channel model yielded a complex in which a pyrethroid (deltamethrin) binds between the linker helix {IIL}45 and transmembrane helices {IIS}5, {IIS}6, and {IIIS}6 with its dibromoethenyl and diphenylether moieties oriented in the intra- and extracellular directions, respectively. The {PyR}2 and revised {PyR}1 models explained recently discovered kdr mutations and predicted new deltamethrin-channel contacts. Further model-driven mutagenesis identified seven new pyrethroid-sensing residues, three in the revised {PyR}1 and four in {PyR}2. Our data support the following conclusions: 1) each pyrethroid receptor is formed by a linker-helix L45 and three transmembrane helices (S5 and two S6s); 2) {IIS}6 contains four residues that contribute to {PyR}1 and another four to {PyR}2; 3) seven pairs of pyrethroid-sensing residues are located in symmetric positions within {PyR}1 and {PyR}2; and 4) pyrethroids bind to {PyR}1 and {PyR}2 in similar orientations, penetrating deeply into the respective domain interfaces. Our study elaborates the dual pyrethroid-receptor sites concept and provides a structural background for rational development of new insecticides.},

Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate and propagate action potentials. Here, we present the cryo-{EM} structure of {EeNav}1.4, the Nav channel from electric eel, in complex with the β1 subunit at 4.0 Å resolution. The immunoglobulin domain of β1 docks onto the extracellular L5I and L6IV loops of {EeNav}1.4 via extensive polar interactions, and the single transmembrane helix interacts with the third voltage-sensing domain ({VSDIII}). The {VSDs} exhibit “up” conformations, while the intracellular gate of the pore domain is kept open by a digitonin-like molecule. Structural comparison with closed {NavPaS} shows that the outward transfer of gating charges is coupled to the iris-like pore domain dilation through intricate force transmissions involving multiple channel segments. The {IFM} fast inactivation motif on the {III}-{IV} linker is plugged into the corner enclosed by the outer S4-S5 and inner S6 segments in repeats {III} and {IV}, suggesting a potential allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation.},

	abstract = {Activation and inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels are critical for proper electrical signaling in excitable cells. Pyrethroid insecticides promote activation and inhibit inactivation of sodium channels, resulting in prolonged opening of sodium channels. They preferably bind to the open state of the sodium channel by interacting with two distinct receptor sites, pyrethroid receptor sites {PyR}1 and {PyR}2, formed by the interfaces of domains {II}/{III} and I/{II}, respectively. Specific mutations in {PyR}1 or {PyR}2 confer pyrethroid resistance in various arthropod pests and disease vectors. Recently, a unique mutation, N1575Y, in the cytoplasmic loop linking domains {III} and {IV} ({LIII}/{IV}) was found to coexist with a {PyR}2 mutation, L1014F in {IIS}6, in pyrethroid-resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. To examine the role of this mutation in pyrethroid resistance, N1575Y alone or N1575Y + L1014F were introduced into an Aedes aegypti sodium channel, {AaNav}1-1, and the mutants were functionally examined in Xenopus oocytes. N1575Y did not alter {AaNav}1-1 sensitivity to pyrethroids. However, the N1575Y + L1014F double mutant was more resistant to pyrethroids than the L1014F mutant channel. Further mutational analysis showed that N1575Y could also synergize the effect of L1014S/W, but not L1014G or other pyrethroid-resistant mutations in {IS}6 or {IIS}6. Computer modeling predicts that N1575Y allosterically alters {PyR}2 via a small shift of {IIS}6. Our findings provide the molecular basis for the coexistence of N1575Y with L1014F in pyrethroid resistance, and suggest an allosteric interaction between {IIS}6 and {LIII}/{IV} in the sodium channel.},

	abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channels are critical for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in most excitable cells. Activation of Na(+) channels initiates an action potential, and fast inactivation facilitates repolarization of the membrane by the outward K(+) current. Fast inactivation is also the main determinant of the refractory period between successive electrical impulses. Although the voltage sensor of domain {IV} ({DIV}) has been implicated in fast inactivation, it remains unclear whether the activation of {DIV} alone is sufficient for fast inactivation to occur. Here, we functionally neutralize each specific voltage sensor by mutating several critical arginines in the S4 segment to glutamines. We assess the individual role of each voltage-sensing domain in the voltage dependence and kinetics of fast inactivation upon its specific inhibition. We show that movement of the {DIV} voltage sensor is the rate-limiting step for both development and recovery from fast inactivation. Our data suggest that activation of the {DIV} voltage sensor alone is sufficient for fast inactivation to occur, and that activation of {DIV} before channel opening is the molecular mechanism for closed-state inactivation. We propose a kinetic model of sodium channel gating that can account for our major findings over a wide voltage range by postulating that {DIV} movement is both necessary and sufficient for fast inactivation.},

	abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is a common goal in biology, and is usually facilitated by having an accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program {MODELLER} and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis ({TvLDH}) is described as an example. The download and installation of the {MODELLER} software is also described.},
